# Android Clean Architecture

A demo android app showcasing Clean Architecture, written in Kotlin and featuring Jetpack Compose for modern, declarative UIs. ðŸ’¯ðŸŽž


# Features
1. **List of List Member**: The app can be accessed list of Game of Thrones House List Member.
2. **Details Screen**: Allows users to show the detasils of every house members.


# Clean Architecture

The core principles of the clean approach can be summarized as followed:

#### 1. The application code is separated into layers.

These layers define the separation of concerns inside the code base.

#### 2. The layers follow a strict dependency rule.

Each layer can only interact with the layers below it.

#### 3. As we move toward the bottom layer â€” the code becomes generic.

The bottom layers dictate policies and rules, and the upper layers dictate implementation details such as the database, networking manager, and UI.

# Architecture Layers

The application consists of three layers:

The domain layer, the data layer, and the presentation layer.
